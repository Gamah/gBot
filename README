This is gBot, a Python 3 irc bot written by noobs for noobs. 
It's meant to be easy to understand and easy to adapt without the use of pre-existing IRC libraries.

Non-standard modules:
lxml
requests

Setup:
1.) Install non-standard modules however you like, I suggest pip. Testing and deployment of this project lives entirely in Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10.
2.) Modify `cfg.py` file to fit your parameters as necesasry.
3.) Run `python3 gbot.py` in your favorite terminal. I do this in a screen session for monitoring.


To-Do:
Remove dependency on external requests module, do all HTTP things with urllib
Implement !help command which dynamically handles existing commands
Detect connection failure and reconnect
Refactor socket parsing
A lot of other stuff...
