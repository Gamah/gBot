This is gBot, a Python 3 irc bot written by noobs for noobs. 
It's meant to be easy to understand and easy to adapt without the use of pre-existing IRC libraries.

Non-standard modules:
lxml
requests

Setup:
1.) Install non-standard modules however you like, I suggest pip. Testing and deployment of this project lives entirely in Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10.
2.) Modify cfg.py file to fit your parameters as necesasry.
3.) Run python3 gbot.py in your favorite terminal. I do this in a screen session for monitoring.


To-Do:
Implement !help command which dynamically handles existing commands
Detect connection failure and reconnect
Refactor socket parsing
A lot of other stuff.
