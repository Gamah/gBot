This is gBot, a Python 3 irc bot written by noobs for noobs. 
It's meant to be easy to understand and easy to adapt without the use of pre-existing IRC libraries.

TODO:
Implement !help command which dynamically handles existing commands
Detect connection failure and reconnect
Refactor socket parsing
A lot of other stuff.
